# Grandma's Chicken Noodle Soup

I made this soup because it's nice to have a good bowl of noodle soup if you're sick, or if it's cold outside.

You can also change the laziness level on this soup, depending on how much you want to cook.

Enjoy!

	* 1x whole rotisserie chicken, meat pulled off bones
