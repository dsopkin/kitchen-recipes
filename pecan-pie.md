# Pecan Pie #4

This one took some experimenting. I had to get the perfect amount of gooeyness, with my own twist.

## Ingredients

### Filling

1 cup granulated sugar  
3 tablespoons brown sugar  
1/2 teaspoons salt  
1 cup corn syrup (light or dark)  
1/3 cup melted salted butter  
1 teaspoon vanilla  
3 whole eggs beaten  
1 cup (heaping) chopped pecans  
Shot or 2 of brandy or kahluaÂ  

## Directions

1. Preheat  oven to 350 degrees F.

2. Mix the granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, corn syrup, butter, vanilla and eggs together in a bowl. Set aside.

3. Prepare your pie shell. If you have a frozen shell (totally ok), you'll want to defrost it a bit.

4. Put most of the pecans in the bottom of the shell. Pour the filling slurry over the pecans. Finish off with whole pecans (make it look good).

5. Cover the top and crust lightly/gently with foil.

6. Put in oven and bake for 30 minutes.

7. Remove the foil, and then continue baking for 20 minutes, being careful not to burn the crust or pecans. When you remove it, it shouldn't be overly jiggly, though a little is ok. If it shakes a lot, cover with foil and bake an additional 20 minutes; the timing can vary wildly.

8. Cool on wire rack for a few hours or overnight. Serve in generous slices.
